# How it works

This is a simple WPF application with a single window, running Stockfish as a child process.

# Usage

To get a position evaluation, you need to click the 'Advice' button in the status bar or press F1 during your move.

The advisor supports both popular chess websites. You can switch between them at any time.

You can play either anonymously or in your account. All modes are supported â€” playing against people, bots, solving puzzles, and studies.

# Configuring

The advisor itself is a portable application. It can be downloaded from **Releases** and unpacked into any folder. However, it requires Stockfish to work. Stockfish is free; download it from [here](https://stockfishchess.org/download/), place it in any folder (you can put it directly in the advisor's folder), and specify the full path to it in the **App.config** file

```xml
<appSettings>
	<add key="StockFishPath" value="D:\Users\Murad\StockFish\stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe" />
</appSettings>
```
